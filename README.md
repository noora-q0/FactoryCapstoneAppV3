## Sections

### 1. Dataset Overview Dashboard

## Overview Tab

The Overview Tab provides foundational insights into the dataset, offering a variety of visualizations to help understand data structure, variability, and feature relationships. Each sub-tab includes specific analyses:

### 1. Data Distribution
- **Purpose**: Displays the spread of values for each feature, helping to identify typical ranges, trends, and any significant outliers.
- **Displays**: Histograms and density plots for each main feature, highlighting common values and any unusual data points.

### 2. Box Plots
- **Purpose**: Highlights the variability and identifies outliers for each feature, crucial for assessing stability in each process variable.
- **Displays**: Box plots with median, quartile ranges, and outliers, offering insights into each featureâ€™s consistency and range.

### 3. Correlation Heatmap
- **Purpose**: Visualizes relationships between features, enabling identification of highly correlated pairs, which may indicate dependencies or interactions.
- **Displays**: A heatmap showing correlation coefficients for feature pairs, with color gradients reflecting the strength and direction of relationships.

### 4. Time Series Trends
- **Purpose**: Tracks changes in features over time, useful for detecting patterns, seasonal effects, or shifts that might impact output measurements.
- **Displays**: Line charts for time-based data, providing a view of feature trends across different time intervals.
