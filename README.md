### 3. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Conduct exploratory data analysis on the dataset, providing insights into distributions, correlations, and basic statistical summaries.

### 4. Clustering

Apply clustering techniques to group similar patterns within the dataset, revealing potential patterns or distinct groups in the data.

### 5. Predictions

Generate predictions for key metrics and display them alongside confidence intervals, allowing users to anticipate future values.

### 6. Feature Importance Analysis

Display feature importance rankings to understand which factors contribute the most to predictive models.

### 7. Error Threshold Analysis

Identify when measurements exceed predefined error thresholds, helping to monitor performance consistency.

### 8. Error Distribution Analysis

Visualize the distribution of errors to understand how often deviations occur and their magnitudes.

### 9. Anomaly Detection

Detect and highlight anomalies in the data, which may indicate issues in the factory process that require attention.

### 10. Cumulative Error Tracking

Track cumulative errors over time to monitor long-term trends and potential areas of improvement.

### 11. Correlation Analysis

Analyze correlations between different variables to understand relationships and potential dependencies within the data.
